You would add the following two lines to your .gitignore:

  ```console
*.png           # ignore all png files
!final.png      # except final.png
  ```

The exclamation point operator will include a previously excluded entry.

Note also that because youâ€™ve previously committed ```.png``` files in this lesson they will not be ignored with this new rule. Only future additions of ```.png``` files added to the root directory will be ignored.
