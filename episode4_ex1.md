## 4.1 Choosing a Commit Message

Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the last commit made to guacamole.md?

1. “Changes”
1. “Changed lemon for lime”
1. “Guacamole modified to the traditional recipe”

<details>
  <summary>
        Solution
  </summary>

Answer 1 is not descriptive enough, and the purpose of the commit is unclear; and answer 2 is redundant to using “git diff” to see what changed in this commit; but answer 3 is good: short, descriptive, and imperative.
