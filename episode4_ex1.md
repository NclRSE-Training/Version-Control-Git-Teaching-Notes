## 4.1 Choosing a Commit Message

Which of the following commit messages would be most appropriate for the last commit made to ```guacamole.md```?

1. “Changes”
1. “Changed lemon for lime”
1. “Guacamole modified to the traditional recipe”

<details>
  <summary>
    Solution
  </summary>

  <p>
    Answer 1 is not descriptive enough, and the purpose of the commit is unclear; and answer 2 is redundant to using <code>git diff</code> to see what changed in this commit; but answer 3 is good: short, descriptive, and imperative.
