  Solution â€“ USE WITH CAUTION!

### Background

Removing files from a git repository needs to be done with caution. To remove files from the working tree and not from your working directory, use

```bash
  $ rm filename
  ```

The file being removed has to be in sync with the branch head with no updates. If there are updates, the file can be removed by force by using the -f option. Similarly a directory can be removed from git using ```rm -r dirname``` or ```rm -rf dirname```.
 ### Solution

Git keeps all of its files in the ```.git``` directory. To recover from this little mistake, Alfredo can just remove the ```.git``` folder in the cocktails subdirectory by running the following command from inside the recipes directory:

```bash
  $ rm -rf cocktails/.git
  ```

But be careful! Running this command in the wrong directory, will remove the entire Git history of a project you might want to keep. Therefore, always check your current directory using the command ```pwd```.
